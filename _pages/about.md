I'm Aleksandar Vuckovic, a software engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from TU Wien. I’m passionate about embedded systems, hardware-software integration, and open-source development.

Here on this blog, I’ll share extended write-ups on problems I encounter, along with my research and solutions. It’s partly a guide for myself to come back to, and hopefully something useful for you if you run into similar issues. Whether you’re debugging firmware, exploring embedded systems, working with Linux, networking, VPNs, or building automation workflows—maybe something here will save you a few hours.

On my [GitHub](http://github.com/vuckale), I share personal projects, tools, and guides—ranging from mechanical keyboard builds to scripts that improve system security and automation. For me, coding is not just a profession; it’s a way to solve real problems, experiment with ideas, and contribute to a community I learn from every day.

If you're into embedded tech, mechanical keyboards, or linux, there's probably something you'd find here!

[comment]: <> Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

[comment]: <> Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

[comment]: <> Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
