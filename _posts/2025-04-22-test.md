title: Creating an Isolated VPN Namespace with WireGuard

description: This guide walks you through building a fully isolated VPN environment using Linux network namespaces. You’ll create a virtual network, configure NAT and DNS, and run a WireGuard tunnel entirely within its own namespace. This allows for sandboxed VPN traffic without affecting your main system.

In this post, I’m setting up secure remote access to an isolated network using WireGuard. This is useful for scenarios where you need to reach machines on a private or segmented network—like lab setups, internal servers, or test environments—without punching holes in firewalls or exposing anything to the internet. The goal is to keep the network locked down while still being able to interact with it when needed, using a clean, minimal VPN tunnel. This setup assumes a Linux environment and uses systemd to manage the WireGuard interface through wg-quick, allowing the tunnel to start automatically at boot. While WireGuard is cross-platform, this post focuses strictly on the Linux side.

## Step 1: Create the Network Namespace

Network namespaces let you build isolated networking environments on a single machine — each with its own interfaces, routing tables, and DNS settings. We'll start by creating one named `vpnspace`.

### Command:
```bash
sudo ip netns add vpnspace
```

To confirm it was created:
```bash
ip netns list
```
You should see `vpnspace` listed.

---

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Ethernet Pair

To connect your main system to the new namespace, you need a virtual network cable — a *veth* pair. It acts like a tunnel between the two environments.

### Command:
```bash
sudo ip link add veth0 type veth peer name veth1
```

This creates:
- `veth0`: stays in the **host**
- `veth1`: will be moved into `vpnspace`

To check both were created:
```bash
ip link show
```

Look for entries like `veth0` and `veth1`.

---

## Step 3: Move One End Into the Namespace

Now isolate one end of the pair by moving `veth1` into the `vpnspace`.

### Command:
```bash
sudo ip link set veth1 netns vpnspace
```

To confirm:
- On the host:
  ```bash
  ip link show
  ```
  `veth1` should be gone.
  
- Inside the namespace:
  ```bash
  sudo ip netns exec vpnspace ip link show
  ```
  You should see `veth1` and `lo`.

---

## Step 4: Assign IP Addresses

We’ll assign IPs to each end of the virtual cable using the subnet `10.200.200.0/24`.

### Why this subnet?
- It's part of `10.0.0.0/8`, a private range (RFC1918).
- Less likely to conflict with common home networks (like `192.168.0.0/24`).
- A `/24` netmask gives 256 usable addresses, which is more than enough here.

We'll use:
- `10.200.200.1` on `veth0` (host)
- `10.200.200.2` on `veth1` (namespace)

---

### Assign IP to the Host Side
```bash
sudo ip addr add 10.200.200.1/24 dev veth0
sudo ip link set veth0 up
```

To verify:
```bash
ip addr show veth0
```

---

### Assign IP to the Namespace Side
```bash
sudo ip netns exec vpnspace ip addr add 10.200.200.2/24 dev veth1
sudo ip netns exec vpnspace ip link set veth1 up
sudo ip netns exec vpnspace ip link set lo up
```

To verify:
```bash
sudo ip netns exec vpnspace ip addr show
```

---

## Step 5: Add a Default Route in the Namespace

Tell the namespace to send all outgoing traffic to the host, which will act as a gateway.

### Command:
```bash
sudo ip netns exec vpnspace ip route add default via 10.200.200.1
```

To confirm:
```bash
sudo ip netns exec vpnspace ip route
```
You should see:
```
default via 10.200.200.1 dev veth1
```

---

## Step 6: Set Up NAT (Internet Access)

Your host will now masquerade (translate) outbound traffic from the namespace so it can access the internet.

First, determine your host’s internet-facing interface:

```bash
ip route | grep default
```

Look for something like:
```
default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
```

Use that interface (e.g., `eth0`) in the next command:

```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.200.200.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
```

To see that the rule was added:
```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -L POSTROUTING -n --line-numbers
```

---

## Step 7: Allow Forwarding Between Interfaces

Assuming your main interface is `eth0`, adjust the firewall to allow traffic through.

```bash
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i veth0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o veth0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
```

---

## Step 8: Test Basic Connectivity

Try pinging from inside the namespace:

```bash
sudo ip netns exec vpnspace ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
```

You should see successful responses. If not, double-check IPs, NAT, and routing.

---

## Step 9: Configure Static DNS in the Namespace

By default, the namespace doesn't inherit your system's DNS. We'll add a static one.

### Command:
```bash
echo "nameserver 1.1.1.1" | sudo tee /etc/netns/vpnspace/resolv.conf
```

Other valid options:
- `8.8.8.8` (Google)
- `9.9.9.9` (Quad9)

To check:
```bash
cat /etc/netns/vpnspace/resolv.conf
```

Now test DNS resolution:
```bash
sudo ip netns exec vpnspace ping -c 4 google.com
```

---

## Step 10: Prepare WireGuard Configuration

WireGuard config files should stay in the standard location:

```
/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```

Do **not** move them into `/etc/netns/vpnspace/`.

Make sure to **disable the DNS option** in your config.

### Example `wg0.conf`:
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <your-private-key>
Address = 10.2.0.2/32
# DNS = 10.2.0.1   <-- disable or remove this

[Peer]
PublicKey = <peer-public-key>
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
Endpoint = <vpn-endpoint>:51820
```

---

## Step 11: Start WireGuard in the Namespace

Bring up the VPN interface using `wg-quick`:

```bash
sudo ip netns exec vpnspace wg-quick up wg0
```

You should see logs like:
```
[#] ip link add wg0 type wireguard
[#] wg setconf wg0 /dev/fd/63
[#] ip -4 address add ...
[#] ip link set mtu ...
```

---

## Step 12: Confirm VPN is Active

To check the public IP from inside the namespace:

```bash
sudo ip netns exec vpnspace curl ifconfig.me
```

Now compare that with your host’s IP:

```bash
curl ifconfig.me
```

The namespace should now show the **VPN's exit IP**, while the host retains its original IP.

## Final Automation Script

Here’s a full setup script to automate everything:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create namespace
ip netns add vpnspace 2>/dev/null

# Create veth pair
ip link add veth0 type veth peer name veth1 2>/dev/null
ip link set veth1 netns vpnspace

# Assign IPs
ip addr add 10.200.200.1/24 dev veth0 || true
ip link set veth0 up

ip netns exec vpnspace ip addr add 10.200.200.2/24 dev veth1 || true
ip netns exec vpnspace ip link set veth1 up
ip netns exec vpnspace ip link set lo up

# Add default route
ip netns exec vpnspace ip route add default via 10.200.200.1 || true

# Enable NAT (adjust interface as needed)
iptables -t nat -C POSTROUTING -s 10.200.200.0/24 -o ens18 -j MASQUERADE 2>/dev/null || \
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.200.200.0/24 -o ens18 -j MASQUERADE

# Allow forwarding
iptables -C FORWARD -i veth0 -o ens18 -j ACCEPT 2>/dev/null || \
iptables -A FORWARD -i veth0 -o ens18 -j ACCEPT

iptables -C FORWARD -i ens18 -o veth0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT 2>/dev/null || \
iptables -A FORWARD -i ens18 -o veth0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

# Start WireGuard
ip netns exec vpnspace wg-quick up wg0
```

Save this to `/usr/local/bin/vpnspace-setup.sh`, then:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/vpnspace-setup.sh
sudo /usr/local/bin/vpnspace-setup.sh
```

---

You now have a fully working, isolated VPN namespace using WireGuard.
